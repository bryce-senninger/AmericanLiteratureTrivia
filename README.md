## Project Overview: Exploration of Time Based jQuery Function Calls

This trivia game utilizes a combination of html, css, and jQuery to create a trivia web game. Time based function callbacks are used to create time limit countdowns for each question. Timeouts are also used to append a unique correct/incorrect/timeup feedback response for a predetermined amount of time before automatically rendering the next question and beginning the next count down. Upon game end, the user is presented with information regarding the number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.
