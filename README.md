## Exploration of Time Based jQuery Function Calls

This trivia game utilizes a combination of html, css, and jQuery. Time based function callbacks are used to create a time limit for each question, and used to append a unique correct/incorrect/timeup feedback response for a predetermined amount of time before automatically rendering the next question and beginning the next count down.
